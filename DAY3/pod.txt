what is a pod?
===============
--> A pod is the smallest building block or basic unit of scheduling in Kubernetes.

--> A Pod always runs on a Node.

--> In a Kubernetes cluster, a pod represents a running process.

--> Inside a pod, you can have one or more containers. Those containers all share a unique network IP, storage, network and any other specification applied to the pod.

--> POD is a group of one or more containers which will be running on some node

--> Each Pod has its unique IP Address within the cluster.


Pod Lifecycle
-------------

--> Make a Pod reuqest to API server using a local pod defination file
--> The API server saves the info for the pod in ETCD
--> The scheduler finds the unscheduled pod and shedules it to node.
--> Kubelet running on the node, sees the pod sheduled and fires up container-runtime.
--> The entire lifecycle state of the pod is stored in ETCD.


Pod Concepts
-------------
--> Pod is ephemeral(lasting for a very short time) and won’t be rescheduled to a  new node once it dies.
--> You should not directly create/use Pod for deployment, Kubernetes have  controllers like Replica Sets, Deployment, Deamon sets to keep pod alive.

--> There are two model types of pod you can create:


One-container-per-pod. 
----------------------
This model is  the most popular. POD is the “wrapper”  for a single container. Since pod is the  smallest object that K8S recognizes, it  manages the pods instead of directly  managing the containers.


Multi-container-pod or Sidecar  containers 
------------------------------------------
In this model, a pod can hold  multiple co-located containers primary  container And utility container that  helps or enhances how an application  functions (examples of sidecar  containers are log shippers/watchers  and monitoring agents).

How to list k8s objects?
-------------------------

kubectl api-resources

How to list namespace level objects?
------------------------------------

kubectl api-resources --namespaced=true

How to list cluster level objects?
----------------------------------

kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false



pod syntax
===========

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
  name: <pod name>
  labels: 
   <key>: <value>
  namespace: <nsName>
spec:
   containers:
    - name: <containeName>
      image: <registry/repo:tag>
      ports:
      - containerPort: <containerPort>
      env:
      - name: <NAME>
        value: <value>
        
save: app1.yaml

apply: kubectl apply -f app1.yaml




EXAMPLE 1:
===========

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: test-ns
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80



Example 2:
=========


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: javawebappTest
  labels:
    app: javawebappTest
  namespace: test-ns
spec:
  containers:
  - name: javawebapp1
    image: kkeducation123456/maven-web-app:1.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080






Example 3
==========
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
  name: mogodbpod
  namespace: db-ns
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mongodbcontainer
    image: mongo
    ports:
    -  containerPort: 27017



=================================================================


kubectl describe po <podName> -n <NameSpace>


IQ] Before starting pod , i need to do sanity how to do?

Ans: kubectl apply -f abc.yaml -v=8

IQ] in which worker node my pod is running how to check?

Ans: kubectl get po -o wide


IQ] what is the meaning of 1/1, 2/2, 1/2, 0/2 ?

Ans:  1/1 means inside a pod we have a one container and that is running

      0/1 means inside a pod we have a one container and that is not running



Assignment : pls create a pods 
==========

tomcat

Jenkins

mongo
